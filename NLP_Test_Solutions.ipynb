These metrics vary depending on the type of task (e.g., classification, regression) and the specific requirements of the application. Common performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC).\n",

This process is repeated multiple times, and performance metrics are averaged across folds to provide a robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",

        "3. **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Model evaluation helps identify whether a model is overfitting (performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data) or underfitting (failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data). Balancing model complexity and generalization performance is essential for selecting the best model.\n",

        "Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features from the original set of features in a dataset. The goal is to remove irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features that may degrade model performance or introduce unnecessary complexity, thereby improving model interpretability, generalization, and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Aspects of Feature Selection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Filter Methods:** Evaluate the relevance of individual features based on statistical measures such as correlation, mutual information, or significance tests and select the most informative features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Wrapper Methods:** Train the machine learning model using different subsets of features and evaluate their performance using cross-validation or other validation techniques. Select the subset of features that maximizes model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Embedded Methods:** Incorporate feature selection as part of the model training process, where the algorithm automatically selects the most relevant features during training. Techniques such as regularization (e.g., L1 regularization) penalize the coefficients of less important features, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Difference between Feature Engineering and Feature Selection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Objective:** Feature engineering aims to create or transform features to improve model performance, while feature selection focuses on identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features from the original set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Approach:** Feature engineering involves modifying the dataset by creating new features or transforming existing ones, whereas feature selection involves evaluating and ranking features based on their relevance and importance.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Effect on Model:** Feature engineering can improve the representational power of the model and enable it to capture more complex patterns in the data, while feature selection simplifies the model by removing irrelevant or redundant features, potentially improving interpretability and efficiency."
